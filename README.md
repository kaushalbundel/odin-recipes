# odin-recipes

Exercise-1 of The Odin Project

Objective of the exercise: To build a recipe website. 

My Personal objective while doing this exercise:
1. To first attempt the exercise as directed in the exercise sheet. :heavy_check_mark:
2. To make some additional modification in the exercise as per my wish (Maybe modify the font, add something else like resize image, play with alignment of the image etc.) :heavy_check_mark:

   2.1. Added size limitations to the images

   2.2. Added target attribute in the a tag so that the links can open in a new tab instead of the original tab

Update (07/06/2023)
Over all the pages are looking beautiful. But the beautification is a time taking activity and hence further amendments will be taken up at a later time.

1. CSS added

Things to be done:
1. Move the footer to the bottom of the page on index.html
2. h2 and h3 tags to have different fonts
