Objective of the exercise: To build a recipe website. 

My Personal objective while doing this exercise:
1. To first attempt the exercise as directed in the exercise sheet. :heavy_check_mark:
2. To make some additional modification in the exercise as per my wish (Maybe modify the font, add something else like resize image, play with alignment of the image etc.)
