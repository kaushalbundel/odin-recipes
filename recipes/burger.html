        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400g top quality British beef mince (10 per cent fat)</li>
            <li>40g bone marrow (from a 15cm bone, halved lengthways; from butchers, Ocado and Waitrose)</li>
            <li>2 burger buns</li>
            <li>2 lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>Bread and butter pickles</li>
            <li>Â½ beef tomato, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 slices strong cheddar or your favourite cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>For the beef burgers, remove the bone marrow from the bone using a teaspoon, then finely dice it into 3mm cubes. Gently mix it through the mince, then roll into 2 equal-size balls and flatten. Chill in the fridge, covered (see Make Ahead).</li>
           <li>Before cooking, bring the beef burgers up to room temperature (see Make Ahead). If not cooking on a barbecue, heat a large griddle pan over a high heat and brush with oil. Season the burgers generously with salt and pepper, then put them on the barbecue/griddle pan. Cook for 5-10 minutes on each side until browned and cooked through. Remove the burgers from the heat to rest for a few minutes while you prepare the remaining ingredients.</li>
           <li>Split the burger buns and toast the insides on the barbecue/griddle pan for 2 minutes or so until golden.</li>
           <li>Layer the lettuce and pickles onto the buns, add the burger, cheese and burger sauce, then top with the tomato and the bun tops.</li>
        </ol>
